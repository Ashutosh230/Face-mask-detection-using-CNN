# Face-mask-detection-using-CNN
Build a face mask detecting model using face recognition and dense Convolutional neural network 
## Walking through the shared files 
- 1.0 notebook is for data preprocessing which includes systematic data reading and rescaling the grayscaled image dataset then appending the info in 'data' and 'target' as numpy arrays.
- 2.0 notebook, using Keras to setup a convolutional neural network with an i/p - o/p layer having multiple hidden layers between them having a dense layer of 64 neurons, then training our model and analyzing the loss function.
- 3.0 notebook is to test our model on a live cam

#### To test the code clone the repository on your device -> Download the datasets on suitable locations from the given link -> add appropriate path of dataset in the code then run the code .
